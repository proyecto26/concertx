# ConcertX

**ConcertX** exists to help bring unique concerts to life. It's a funding platform where every musician sets their concerts funding goal and deadline.

ConcertX seeks help backers pledge to concerts to help them come to life and support a creative process. To thank their backers for their support, musicians offer unique rewards that speak to the spirit of what they're hoping to create.


## Getting Started 🤘

- Empower People, Recording studios, and Music to create **Web 3.0** concerts.
- From your room, from the comfort of your home, from a recording studio; create music to be heard from anywhere.
- Be rebellious! *Smart contracts* allow trusted transactions directly with your audience without a central authority.
