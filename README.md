# ConcertX

**ConcertX** exists to help bring unique concerts to life. It's a funding platform where every musician sets their concerts funding goal and deadline.

ConcertX seeks help backers pledge to concerts to help them come to life and support a creative process. To thank their backers for their support, musicians offer unique rewards that speak to the spirit of what they're hoping to create.
